    <h3>
     In the spring of 1934, on the Place de l'Europe in Paris, Citroën launched its first traction car, the 7.
 
 Designed to replace the Rosalie, it was a resounding success, thanks to its uniqueness, technical innovations, elegant lines and temperament.
 
 History gave it the nickname "Traction Avant", and it was produced from 1934 to 1957.
 Released too late to save the company, it failed to halt Citroën's bankruptcy and was taken over by the MICHELIN brothers, who went on to achieve fame and success.
 
 Available as a Sedan, Cabriolet, Coupé and Limousine, it also offered a wide range of 7, 9, 11 and 16 HP (15-Six) engines, as well as the rare 22 HP.
 
 Right from the start, the Traction stood out thanks to numerous innovations, including hydraulic brakes, the absence of a chassis, front-wheel drive (in mass production), four independent wheels, a floating overhead-valve engine, universal joints, and even, from 1954, a hydropneumatic suspension system on the rear wheels.
 
 The Traction 15/6's road manners and qualities even earned it the honorary title of "Queen of the Road".
 Such a car, a historic witness to the pre- and post-war era, will enhance your wedding and charm your guests with its extraordinary character.
 
 Its cachet will sublimate your wedding, and the photos you take will make for unforgettable memories.
